# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `qs`!

## Getting started

- Check existing issues: https://github.com/zaytracom/qs/issues
- Open a new issue for bug reports, questions, or feature requests.
- If you plan a larger change, please discuss it in an issue first to align on scope and design.

## Development

- Run tests for the main module: `go test ./...`
- The `demo/` folder is a separate module and can be tested independently: `cd demo && go test ./...`
- Keep changes focused and include tests for new behavior whenever possible.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs small and easy to review.
- Update `README.md` / docs when behavior or API changes.
- Ensure code is formatted (`gofmt`) and CI passes.
